# Now All Of China Knows You Are Here

Per ["Fair Use"](https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/) laws, this is a 2D to 3D transformation *inspired* by the [1998 Mulan animated film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mulan_(1998_film)).

  ^ The photo above depicts each step in the design phases for this project, each one a small change in fit, or style.

This tedius work represents an original 3D interpretation of art from the animated film, for educational purposes, with the intent to demonstrate 2D-to-3D transformation techniques. The resulting objects are not for sale, or for commercial use. The work is based on a substantial, and creative interpretation of unseen viewing angles of the object as presented in 2D animation cells, depicted below in the refrence images.

## Lore
The resulting 3D printable art work functions as an accessory shroud for DB Firearms Czech Nine series, giving it the look and feel of Mulan's [火龙出水](https://baike.baidu.com/item/火龙出水/10405370) [(Huolongchushui)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huolongchushui) style rocket.<br>

Inscribed on the side of the shroud are the words: "Now All of China Knows You're Here", a line spoken in the clip below...<br>

[![Now All of China Knows You're Here](https://img.youtube.com/vi/BCmFPeQouec/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCmFPeQouec)

In this early scene, the Huns (led by Shan Yu) have breached the Great Wall of China. As they overpower the Chinese soldiers guarding the wall, one soldier manages to reach a signal tower. Despite being confronted by Shan Yu, the soldier defiantly lights a signal fire – one of many beacons placed along the Great Wall designed to quickly communicate threats across long distances. 

After the soldier lights the beacon, which triggers other signal fires that rapidly spread across the wall into the distance, Shan Yu calmly states, "Now all of China knows you're here.<br>

The soldier responds, "Perfect."<br>

This exchange is significant for several reasons: It establishes the threat level – Shan Yu isn't concerned about China knowing of his invasion; in fact, he seems pleased that they'll know he's coming. It also demonstrates Shan Yu's confidence and intimidating presence. The line has become iconic partly because it shows Shan Yu's menacing character and foreshadows the conflict that drives the entire story, but it also gained popularity as an internet meme used to humorously indicate when someone has done something that draws widespread attention.

The 火龙出水 (aka Huo Long Chu Shui, or Fire Dragon Out of Water) is a real 2 stage rocket from the Ming Dynasty, and it is the actual inspiration for the rocket shown in the 'Avalanche' scene from Mulan. 

[![Huo Long Chu Shui](https://img.youtube.com/vi/oVyUWEccKw4/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVyUWEccKw4)

In this pivotal scene, Mulan's unit (led by Captain Li Shang) is ambushed by the Hun army in the mountains. When the Huns are charging toward them and the situation looks dire, Mulan grabs the last cannon/rocket from Yao. Instead of aiming it directly at the Hun leader Shan Yu as others had tried to do, she runs toward the mountain and fires the rocket into the snowy mountainside above the Hun army. This strategic move triggers a massive avalanche that buries most of the Hun forces.

## Functional use, and printing
In order to install this shroud, you'll need 3 brass inserts, and their associated screws. I used [M3.5 Tapered Heat-Set Inserts with a 3.81mm installed length from McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com/94180A502/). For the front screw hole, you'll need to line up the shroud, perhaps drill a small hole into your lower, not too deep, and set the heat insert. You should then be able to screw the shroud into the front of the Czech Nine lower to hold it in place. The two holes on the side of the dragon head will need inserts mounted in them. This will allow you to screw through them, and the screws will in turn then snug up against the sides of the lower. You can optionally drill small holes to allow the screws to rest in them preventing movement. If you don't have movement issues with the front hole operating alone, you can omit the side inserts if you like. 

For print testing 2 walls, and 15% gyroid is recommended, use common sense settings when printing the final usable shroud, you can simply use your favorite 3D printed *lower* settings. If you are a 8 walls, 99% rectilinear kind of person, so be it. Print orientation seems only to matter if you want to minimize the number of supports printed. Vertical, horizontal, and 30-45 degree angle prints have all been tested, and all work fine.

## Supported Intratec / Interdynamic uppers

These files should support all known models as long as they are on Czech Nine frames. KG99, Tec-9, and Tec-DC9 should be compatible with the full length KG99-Tec9-DC9-MulanDragon v1.step, where as the shorter KG99-Mini, Tec-9 mini, and AB-10 models will want to use KG99mini-Tec9mini-AB10-MulanDragon v1.step. If you have problems with your barrel clearing the lip of the dragon, you can add a barrel extension, or alternately a 3/4X10 (female) to 3/4X10 (male) suppressor adapter (without the suppressor unless you want it!).

## Inspiration
A Vice News documentary "I 3D-Printed a Glock to See How Far Homemade Guns Have Come" gave me the idea for this project. The opening scenes feature an AWCY Jade Emperor print for the AWCY [Scz0rpion EVO](https://odysee.com/@AreWeCoolYet:7/AWCY-Scz0rpion-EVO-(3d-printed-CZ-Scorpion-EVO3):0). After kicking around a few ideas with an artist friend, she hammered these STEP files out for me instead of allowing me to talk her into trying to recreate the original AWCY dragon head. This took us several weeks of back and forth printing, and measuring.<br>
